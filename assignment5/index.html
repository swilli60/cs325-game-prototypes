<h2>Assignment 5: Pirates! (unfinished)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I think the mechanics of maneuvering the player's boat around are reasonably representative of the way a real boat would have to steer and accelerate and decelerate.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Probably the hardest thing that I managed to accomplish was figuring out how to have the player's ship's velocity change to follow the path as the player steers left and right.
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I made use of the <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/angular-velocity">Phaser Angular Velocity Example</a>. I also had intentions, had I finished, to make use of the <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/shoot-the-pointer">Shoot the Pointer Example</a> in the form of cannonballs shooting between the player's ship and the merchant ship they are trying to plunder, but I did not have the time to implement that funtionality.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
If I had been able to finish, this was intended to be about naval warfare on the high seas between greedy pirates (the player) and a ship of stranded merchants with valuable goods onboard.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Pirates
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game takes input from the mouse to start the game, and then uses the up, left, and right directional keys to maneuver the player's ship around the playing area.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Steering and maneuvering of the player's ship, such as acceleration/deceleration and cornering, and (if I had gotten cannon fire implemented) the cannon fire mechanincs, such as rate of fire, speed, size of cannonballs, all of which determine how easily the player might dodge enemy cannon fire as well as the difficulty of landing a shot on the enemy. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I'd like it to be a game that makes it a real challenge to avoid enemy cannon fire while trying to land your own shots on the enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this game, the player controls a pirate ship. The player can accellerate forward by using the up-arrow key and steer left and right by using the respective arrow keys. The player's ship has inertia, which would add to the challenge of avoiding obstacles like cannonballs, if I had managed to get them in the game. The core gameplay mechanic I had hoped to implement was the ability for the player to fire cannonbals from both the port and starboard sides of the ship, with one keyboard key for each side. I also had hoped to implement enemy cannon fire to give the player a bit of a challenge of dodging enemy fire. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to do so.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise of this game is fairly simple. The player has taken up the role of a crew of pirates aboard their ship, the Mollywhop, sailing across the sea in search of the only thing pirates are ever interested in: gold and other valuable goods ripe for plundering. They come across a merchant ship, the Ganymede, whose main mast was broken in a storm. Stranded, the merchant ship is almost helpless, saave for their cannons, against the theiving pirates you now control.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The intended play time is perhaps 1-2 minutes.
</li>
