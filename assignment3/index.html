<h2>Get away!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Though the mechanic of evading searchlights as enemies search for the player is something I think I've seen before, the top-down view is something I have not seen before.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The searchlights move at different speeds in different directions which adds a bit of interest to the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
As this is the first Phaser game I've made (since I "passed" on the first two digital assignments), I learned that Phaser has many aspects to it and it is rather tricky learning the intricacies of how all the componenets of Phaser work together.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I did not make any of my sources from scratch:
    background art: https://thegameassetsmine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/back4-300x300.jpg
    sound effect of a jail cell door closing (which I was unable to get to play): https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-track/jail-cell-door-426739/
    The sprite for player character came from the source files from this totorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game/part4

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I would say a game that this closely resembles is a game I played a few years ago called "Monaco: What's Yours is Mine."
    As far as code that I used, here are some Phaser examples from which I borrowed (and modified code):

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A game about escaping from prison guards who are seeking to reimprison the player if they find them with their searchlights.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Caught!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used the keyboard directional keys for player movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Escaping from the searchlights without too much ease or difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to have a fun challenge trying to stay out of the searchlights.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This prototype is about a newly (almost) escaped prison inmate. Having just broken out of prison, they are fleeing as the prison guards emply searchlights to atempt to find the player who assumes the role of the escapee who is attempting to make it to the river to lose sight of the searchlights and break any scent trail they might leave behind. The player uses the direction keys to maneuver around the three searchlights and get to the river. Upon doing so, the player wins. If the player comes into contact with any of the searchlights, they lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect the player will attemt to make the quickest path across the playing field as they dodge searchlights.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is no real story to speak of in the game. The only characters present in the game would be the escaped inmate attempting to reach freedom.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game seems like it could be most apealing to casual gamers, as the game rounds go very quickly.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 30 seconds or less.
</li>
